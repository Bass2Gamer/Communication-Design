                    The parliamentary elections in Poland have ended, and now the new government is being built. But we
                    want
                    to focus on the parliamentary elections, give a background of
                    the parties and tell a story using data gathered from the elections and explain why geography can
                    influence the votes.

                <h2>Polish parliament system</h2>
                <p>Poland has a bicameral parliament consisting of two houses:

                    The Sejm: The lower house, which is more powerful and plays a major role in lawmaking. It consists
                    of 460 deputies (members) who are elected for a four-year term.

                    The Senate: The upper house, with 100 senators also elected for a four-year term. The Senate's role
                    is primarily to review and amend the bills passed by the Sejm,
                    although it has less power compared to the Sejm.

                    Let`s focus on the Sejm .

                    For the Sejm, Poland uses a proportional representation system. Voters choose from party lists in
                    multi-member constituencies, and seats are allocated according to the
                    percentage of votes each party receives.

                    The political landscape is diverse, with several parties typically represented in the Sejm. The two
                    major parties in recent years have been the Law and Justice Party (PiS)
                    and the Civic Platform (PO), now part of the larger Civic Coalition (KO). </p>

                <h2>PiS Backstory</h2>
                <p>Funded in 2001 by two twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, The party was created on a wave of
                    popularity gained by Lech Kaczyński while heading the Polish
                    Ministry of Justice, Both brothers played a prominent role in Polish politics, with Lech Kaczyński
                    later becoming President of Poland in 2005 until his tragic death in a
                    plane crash in 2010.</p>
                <p>PiS's political ideology is often characterized as conservative, nationalist, and Eurosceptic. Its
                    platform combines a commitment to traditional, Catholic social values with a strong emphasis on
                    social welfare, state intervention in the economy, and law and order. The party is also known for
                    its
                    scepticism towards further European integration and its stance on preserving Polish sovereignty
                    within the EU framework.</p>
                <p>In its early years, PiS was part of the broader coalition government. The party's popularity grew
                    steadily, appealing to voters who were disillusioned with the liberal economic policies of previous
                    governments and who favoured a more traditional, patriotic narrative.

                    PiS first came to significant power in 2005, when Lech Kaczyński was elected President and the
                    party formed a coalition government after the parliamentary elections. This period marked the
                    beginning of its influence in shaping Poland's domestic and foreign policies.

                    Since its founding, PiS has played a major role in Polish politics, often polarizing public opinion.
                    Its
                    policies and approach to governance, particularly regarding judicial reforms and media freedom,
                    have been subjects of both domestic and international scrutiny and debate.

                <h2>Civic Platform Backstory</h2>
                <p>Civic Platform was founded in 2001 as a center-right political party. It was established by Andrzej
                    Olechowski, Donald Tusk, and Maciej Płażyński. The formation was a
                    response to the perceived need for a moderate, pro-European Union political force in Poland,
                    positioned as a counterbalance to the more conservative Law and Justice
                    Party (PiS) and the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).</p>

                <p>
                    Originally, PO positioned itself as a liberal-conservative party with a
                    strong emphasis on free-market economics, European integration, and
                    modernization of the state. The party appealed to middle-class voters,
                    entrepreneurs, and those supportive of Poland's integration into the
                    European Union.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PO quickly became one of the leading political forces in Poland. Its
                    popularity surged in the mid-2000s, particularly under the leadership of
                    Donald Tusk. Tusk's tenure as the party leader and his premiership
                    (2007-2014) marked the peak of PO's influence in Polish politics.
                </p>
                <p>PO formed a government after the 2007 parliamentary elections, leading to Donald Tusk becoming Prime
                    Minister. During its time in power, PO focused on economic
                    liberalization, administrative reform, and strengthening Poland's position within the EU. Tusk's
                    government was also noted for its pragmatic approach to foreign policy,
                    especially relations with Germany and Russia.



                    In the face of rising competition from PiS and changing political dynamics, PO sought to broaden its
                    appeal. This led to the formation of the Civic Coalition in 2018, an
                    electoral alliance spearheaded by PO but including other smaller parties and political movements.
                    The aim was to create a more united front against the increasingly
                    dominant PiS.



                    Despite its successes, PO (and later KO) faced various challenges, including internal divisions,
                    controversies over certain policies, and a perception among some voters
                    that it had become disconnected from the needs of ordinary Poles. This was partly attributed to its
                    strong pro-EU stance and liberal economic policies, which contrasted
                    with the more nationalist and welfare-oriented approach of PiS.</p>

                <h2>PiS controversies</h2>
                <h3>Judiciary under government control</h3>
                <p>Julia Przylebska, a former judge and diplomat, was one of the most well-known recipients of such an
                    appointment when she has been appointed president of Poland's
                    constitutional court in 2015. A few standard procedural steps were omitted, making the appointment
                    controversial. </p>
                <h3>Attack on the media independence</h3>
                <p>Following PiS's electoral victory in 2015, the government took control of Poland's state media, which
                    since then has continuously promoted a favourable image of the
                    ruling party and highlighted matters that the party considers significant. Journalists who refused
                    to follow this new direction were forced to leave or face dismissal.</p>
                <h3>Targeting migrants and the LGBTQ+ community</h3>
                <p>PiS has specifically agitated against two groups in an effort to influence public opinion in its
                    favour: immigrants and members of the LGBTQ+ community. President
                    Andrzej Duda, a close associate of PiS, stated in 2020 that the LGBTQ+ movement is an ideology
                    rather than people.
                </p>
                <h3>Restrictive abortion laws</h3>
                <p>The strengthening of Poland's abortion regulations, which were already among the most restrictive in
                    Europe, is another significant legacy of the PiS administration.
                    Poland's constitutional court decided in favour of a law that only permits abortion in cases of rape
                    and a threat to the mother's life or health in October 2020, despite
                    widespread protests. The new rule requires parents of children who are terminally ill or severely
                    disabled to bring their newborns to term.</p>

                <h2>Votes</h2>
                <p>Despite the negative actions of the Law and Justice, the party got a majority in Parliament. They
                    acquired 35.38% of the votes. Right behind them with a score of 30.70%
                    was KO the party that previously was in power and was always a political rival of PiS. Nonetheless,
                    they could not create a government by themselves since they lacked
                    a few seats in the parliament to rule independently. In this situation, they were forced to form a
                    coalition, but no one in the parliament wanted to team up with PiS.</p>

                <p>Let`s focus on the map of Poland, which shows votes by counties. And let us compare them with the
                    votes that KO has gained.

                    The first thing that catches your eye is the distribution of votes in eastern and western Poland,
                    the second noticeable thing is the difference in bigger cities.

                    Let us answer why that is.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scrollText">
                <h2>Vote differences in cities and provinces</h2>
                <p>Law and Justice Party (PiS) is a conservative catholic party which is popular in the province since
                    many people in the area are religious and conservative, but PiS also
                    made promises to farmers and that boosted their popularity in low-populated areas outside of the big
                    cities. PiS's social policies are also very popular with the provincial
                    population, PiS has always been the biggest in the province since the previous government neglected
                    farmers and PiS used it to their advantage. </p>
                <p>Also in the province, there is no alternative for farmers since other parties did not solicit votes
                    from farmers.

                    In the cities, PiS has lower support with the exception of a few cities in the east of the country
                    which are more conservative.

                    But in most of the big cities, PiS policies are not popular and city voters are more diverse when it
                    comes to political views.</p>

                <h2>Votes</h2>
                <p>When we look at the history of regions of Poland we can see that previous history can influence the
                    outcome of the elections.

                    Let`s put this into perspective.</p>

                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <img class="img" src="img/KO votes partitions.png">
                    <img class="img" src="img/Pis votes partitions.png">
                </div>

                <p>Now the map shows the borders of the partitions of Poland on the current map.

                    On the west side, we have the Prussian partition.

                    On the east side, we have the Russian partition.

                    On the South side, we have the Austro-Hungarian partition.

                    Although it may seem that the choice of a specific party will be dictated by the program, in fact,
                    Pole's preferences are influenced by many factors that we would not think
                    about. They are related, for example, to the scope of access to civil rights in individual
                    partitions (including the possibility of association), the partition regime and the
                    family. The latter covers a whole list of elements, such as divorce rate, family size, having your
                    own apartment, distance from schools, religiosity, and even people's
                    sedentary status. Where we come from is also important. It should be noted that the historical
                    context does not reveal the decisive role</p>




                <iframe title="Third Way votes for Sejm by counties" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-OW3ba"
                    src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OW3ba/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                    style="width: 100%; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" data-external="1"></iframe>
                <script
                    type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < e.length; r++)if (e[r].contentWindow === a.source) { var i = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px"; e[r].style.height = i } } })) }();</script>

                <p>As for the historical conditions of space development, this is visible primarily in
                    the case of rural areas. Where large-scale agriculture dominated (Prussian areas),
                    a lower density of social networks is visible. There is higher urbanization and
                    population mobility, and there are no conservative religious communities among
                    farmers.



                    On the Prussian side, the opposition has the biggest support.

                    In areas where there was Russian or Austrian partition, small or medium
                    agricultural ownership dominates. There, electoral preferences are shaped by
                    education and proximity to urban centres. The conservative ideals are dominating.

                    If we compare it to the Third Way which is a centralised party, the votes on the
                    map are even



                    But if we observe Bialystok City which is in Podlaskie Voivodeship is the bastion
                    of conservatism, we can see that people are voting for more liberal parties, this
                    can be explained by the influx of new students that are the source of the new
                    liberal views.</p>

                <h2>Votes</h2>
                <p>Since Poland joined European Union in 2004 many Poles started emigrating across Europe and the World.
                    Many of them settled in the United Kingdom, Netherlands,
                    Germany and Scandinavia.

                    From both maps, we can deduce that the biggest population of Poles abroad is in Germany and the
                    United Kingdom.

                    However, the situation in the USA is different since only 3% of registered citizens have voted from
                    400.000 living in the United States, not including those not registered.</p>
