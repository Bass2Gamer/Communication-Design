                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Since the beginning of
                    Counter Strike in 1999
                    cheating was a problem
                    that stayed to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first mentions of
                    cheating date back to
                    2000 when the Counter
                    Strike was released. They
                    consisted of “trainers”
                    which were mod menus
                    that gave you control over
                    an in game commands
                    such as god mode,
                    unlimited ammo and so
                    forth.</p>

                <h2>Hacks</h2>
                <p>The first software cheats
                    appeared in game before 2001,
                    the recorded mention about
                    cheats can be traced back to
                    September of 2001.types
                    of cheats consisted of aimbot,
                    and wallhacks.

        <section id="current" class="scrollContainer">
            <div class="scrollText">
                <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                <p>The cheats were so prevalent you even couldn`t escape
                    them in professional tournaments. And thanks to growing
                    popularity of CS:GO most of the cheaters from CS 1.6 came
                    to CS:GO.

                    Even the fact of losing an in game inventory did not scare
                    cheaters, but many Counter Strike players knew that VAC
                    was not very effective at banning players swiftly, however
                    the anti-cheat was updated frequently and with help of
                    Overwatch system it became more consistent.

                    The consequence of this are banned accounts and with them
                    locked in game inventory, that can never be accessed by the
                    banned account, which also means that players banned by
                    VAC can not sell their inventory items on Steam Market.</p>

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>In future, Valve will release VAC-NET a deep learning
                    solution that will identify cheater in real time. However
                    Valve did not revealed any details regarding this topic, but
                    the future of Counter Strike looks bright despite few
                    stumbles along the way.</p>
